## Day 2: Password Philosophy

Password validation, completed.

## Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

Trees a downhilling toboggan might encounter, completed.

## Day 4: Passport Processing

Checking validity of passports, completed. Kind of early to have an exercise drive one mad.
Reacquainted myself with Ada's enumerations.

Lost your boarding bass; try to find your seat, completed.

## Day 6: Custom Customs

## Day 7: Handy Haversacks

Acquainted myself with `Containers.Maps` and **`for all`** expressions.
Also learned about initializing records with default values
(use `=> <>`).

## Day 8: Handheld Halting

Debugging a child's handheld, stuck on an infinite loop, completed.
Didn't find anything really new to do this time, aside from
`Pack` an `array` of `Boolean`.
